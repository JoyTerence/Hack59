# Hack59
Website that provides the best experience to a traveller to find hotels as well as providing critical insights to hotels to improve their business.


Designed using mix of python and js, this was our Winning Hackathon implementation at RV College of Engineering, where judges panel included folks from Oracle and Amedeus.

The website took input from the user on his travelling destination and using Amadues API the nearby hotels were determined.

From the regular photos of the hotel interiors a 3D View image was stitched and was presented to the User as a interactive paranoma similar to 'Google Street View'.

User then could navigate virtually through the hotels and thus helping better decision making, which otherwise would have had only Hotel Reviews (good number of which can be easily faked) to rely upon.

While user navigates through the stitched 3D view, we in the backend measure the time spent by the user.

This time is then analyzed to see what was the region of hotel room that captured the user's attention and provide these as representations like Graphs to the hotels which can then analyze these further as it benifits them.
